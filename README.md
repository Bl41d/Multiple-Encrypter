# Multiple-Encrypter
Pass to base64, base32, base16, Caesar, Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal and Blaid (my encrypter)

Hi this is my second project here, thanks for download it, also I want to thank Bl4ckV (https://github.com/Bl4ckV) for helping me to making the .exe for the program.

This program let you pass a text message to base64, base32, base16, Caesar, Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal and Blaid (my encrypter), for Caesar you can put some layers, this would pass the letter to the numbers of layers you put in the entry.

Thanks for download it and share, I will upload new content, have a nice day.

- Blaid
